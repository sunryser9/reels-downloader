Last Updated: [Today's Date, e.g., May 20, 2024]

Thank you for visiting our guide on downloading Instagram Reels. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

This is a static website built on GitHub Pages. We do not have any forms, login systems, or databases. Therefore, we **do not directly collect, store, or process any personal information** from you, such as your name, email address, or IP address.

## 2. Third-Party Services

Our site uses two third-party services that may collect information:

*   **Google AdSense:** We use Google AdSense to display advertisements. Google uses cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. You can learn more about how Google uses data and manage your preferences in [Google's Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).

*   **Affiliate Links:** We participate in affiliate marketing programs. This means we may include affiliate links (e.g., for InVideo), and if you click on one of these links and make a purchase, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you. These third-party sites have their own separate privacy policies.

## 3. GitHub Pages
